# Wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is a fundamental step in the UI/UX design process that focuses on creating the skeletal structure of a user interface. It serves as a blueprint, guiding the design and development of a product. Wireframes help designers and stakeholders visualize the layout, navigation, and functionality of a product before any actual coding begins. By addressing usability challenges early, wireframing reduces risks and ensures a smoother development process.

## Key Elements of Wireframes

Wireframes consist of several core elements that contribute to an effective design:

### 1. **Layout Structure**
   - Defines the overall arrangement of content and components on the interface.
   - **Example**: Aligning a hero section at the top, followed by a grid layout for featured listings.

### 2. **Navigation**
   - Outlines how users move between different pages or sections of the product.
   - **Example**: Including a top navigation bar with links to "Home," "About Us," and "Contact Us."

### 3. **Content Placement**
   - Indicates where text, images, and other media will be displayed.
   - **Example**: Placing a description below a property image in a listing.

### 4. **Functionality**
   - Highlights interactive elements like buttons, forms, and dropdown menus.
   - **Example**: A "Reserve Now" button for booking a property.

## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes can be categorized into two types:

### 1. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**
   - Simplistic and focused on the basic structure and layout.
   - Typically used in the early stages of design to communicate initial ideas.
   - **Use Case**: Sketching the layout of a homepage with placeholders for images and text.

### 2. **High-Fidelity Wireframes**
   - More detailed and includes design elements like colors, fonts, and interactivity.
   - Used later in the design process to provide a realistic preview of the final product.
   - **Use Case**: A complete design of a booking page with interactive buttons and a detailed property description.

**Screens Attached**: The provided screens represent **High-Fidelity Wireframes**, as they include detailed visuals, typography, and functionality.
